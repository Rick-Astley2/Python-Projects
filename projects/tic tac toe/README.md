# Tic-Tac-Toe

Project:
    A Tic-Tac-Toe game that uses a terminal and a grid based system

Features

    - Turn-based play between user and computer.

    - Chess-style coordinate input.

    -  Computer chooses random available spots.

    - Win detection for all rows, columns, and diagonals.

    - Tie detection when the board is full.

What skills this project demonstrates:

    - 2D Grid Representation
        Uses a dictionary to represent the game board with coordinates.

    - User Input Handling
         Accepts and validates player moves.

    -  Random Choice
        Uses random.choice() for computer moves from available spaces.

    - Game Logic
        Detects wins and ties using a list of winning combinations.

    - Formatted Output
        Draws the board with labeled rows and columns after each move.
