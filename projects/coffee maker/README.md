# Coffee-Maker

Project: 
 A program that lets the user select a category of coffee 
 (e.g. Espresso, Drip Coffee, Cold Brew), and then choose a specific type from that category. 
 It validates user input and guides the user through making a selection.

What skills this project demonstrates:

    - Using dictionaries to organize and store data

    - Looping with while True for repeated input until valid

    - Handling user input with input() and formatting it with .title()

    - Validating user input against dictionary keys and values

    - Using string operations like join() to format lists into readable output

    - Writing and organizing code with functions (main, what_catagorie, what_type)

    - Returning values from functions and passing them as arguments
