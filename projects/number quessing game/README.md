# Number-Quessing-Game

Project:
Python console game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

What skilles will be demonstrated:
    - Random Number Generation
    Uses random.randint() to generate a number between 1 and 100.

    - User Input and Type Conversion
    Accepts input from the user and safely converts it to an integer.

    - Input Validation
    Catches and handles invalid input using try/except to prevent program crashes.

    - Control Flow
    Uses if/elif/else statements to guide the game logic.

    - Loops
    Uses a while True loop to repeatedly prompt the user until the correct number is guessed.

    - Basic Debugging and Output Formatting
    Provides helpful feedback like "higher" or "lower" and displays the number of attempts.
