# Stop-Watch
Project:
    a Stop-watch with a the stop

What skilles this project will demonstrate:


    - Time Management
        Uses `time.sleep(1)` to pause for 1 second in each loop cycle.

    - Looping
        Uses an infinite `while True` loop to keep the clock running.

    - Conditional Logic
        Resets seconds and minutes using `if` statements.

    - Formatted Output
        Uses f-strings and padding (`{value:02}`) to ensure two-digit formatting for hours, minutes, and seconds.

    - Efficient Terminal Output
        Uses `end="\r"` to overwrite the previous line, creating a smooth live clock effect.
